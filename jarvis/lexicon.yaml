        Repeat that again. Carefully this time.
        You're talking nonsense.
        I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.
        Are you sure this is what you want me to do? (Hint: it isn't)
        How about you do it yourself if you want it that much.
        Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope. Nope.
        Speak up boy, I can't hear you.
        It appears you are wrong. How utterly shocking.
        Nah, I'm not gonna do something like that.
    bad_index: |-
        That's way outside the box, and I'm not going there to look for it in this weather.
        A more reasonable index value would be nice.
        This index is no good. Try another one.
        I think maybe this index is not within the range of my abilities.

        You'll need to tell what it is you want, before I can go and do it, okay?
        You don't have enough arguments in your command.
        Did you forget to type something? Yes you did.
        That's not enough.
        That's called a Missing Argument Exception or something like that, I don't really know.
not_found:

        I couldn't find anything like that.
