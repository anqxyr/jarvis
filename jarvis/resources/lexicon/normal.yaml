        Do you want {{ first|join(' or ') }} or maybe {{ last }}?
        {{ first|join(', ') }} or {{ last }}. Pick one.
        Ambiguous input. Possible variants: {{ options|join(', ') }}.
        I'm not sure whether you meant {{ first|join(', ') }} or {{ last }}.
        Not quite sure what you wanted here. Was it {{ first|join(', ') }} or {{ last }}?

        I have so many choices for you: {{ options|join(', ') }} and another {{ count }}! Isn't it wonderful?
        Unclear. Clarify. Options: {{ options|join(', ') }}. Number of additional options: {{ count }}
        Did you mean {{ first|join(', ') }} or {{ last }}? You can use !showmore to check another {{ count }} matches.
        Now you choose: {{ options|join(', ') }}. ({{ count }} more)
